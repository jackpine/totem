quickstart
==========

There is a good quickstart doc on react's site, but here is an
abbreviated version:

install watchman to watch for file changes
------------------------------------------

    
    $ brew install watchman

or if you already have watchman installed:

    $ brew upgrade watchman


install the cli react tool
--------------------------

    $ npm install -g react-native-cli

start the react packager
-------------------------

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Run the App
-----------
In Xcode, punch ⌘R

Develop and Debug the App
-------------------------

Once the app has loaded, use ⌘R to reload and ⌘D to launch the
debugger in Chrome (you may need to install an extension)
