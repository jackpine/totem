quickstart
==========

There is a good quickstart doc on react's site, but here is an
abbreviated version:

0) install the cli react tool

    $ npm install -g react-native-cli

1) start the react packager:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

2) In Xcode, ⌘R to run the app

3) once the app has loaded, use ⌘R to reload and ⌘D to launch the
debugger in Chrome (you may need to install an extension)
